### About the CaMa-Flood annual briefing
CaMa-Flood annual progress briefing is a yearly event to review the achievements related to the global river model CaMa-Flood. **This will be an opportunity for CaMa-Flood users/developers/contributors to advertise their achievements,** and also a chance to enhance research network.

The briefing starts with the summary of the key progress report by the core developer team. Then, CaMa-Flood users have opportunity for introducing their achievements in a short-talk series. We are also thinking about having 1-2 invited talks for highlighting important achievements.

The primary purpose of the annual briefing is to make a catalogue of CaMa-Flood researches, and make it visible to CaMa-Flood communities and outward. We'd like to ask CaMa-Flood users/contributors to make a short summary on their achievement (1-2 page), and generate "CaMa-Flood annual progress report" by collecting these summaries. Also, we will record presentations during the online meeting and make it as "video report".

Note: We are also planning to have [CaMa-Flood user/developer meeting](../cmf-mmet-2024/) every two years, which prioritize discussion on frontier topics and future directions. **The annual briefing** primary focuses on summarizing the recent achievements. Of course, networking of CaMa-Flood user community is the most important purpose in the both meetings.

#### Note for presenters

The meeting is for <span style="color: red">sharing the achievements related to CaMa-Flood in 2022-2024</span>. Thus, we assume you published your work in advance (journal publication, online documents, or web contents), and provide the summary of that work in the meeting. (If not yet published, you can introduce it in next year).

Any achievements related to CaMa-Flood can be introduced.
  - Development of a new scheme or tool for CaMa-Flood
  - Applicational studies using CaMa-Flood, such as flood risk assessment
  - New data or tool which is helpful for CaMa-Flood
  - Use of CaMa-Flood in climate/weather services (operational, business, etc).

If you are not sure your achievement fits to the scope, please just ask the meeting organization team (yamazaki [at] iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp).
As this is the first annual briefing event, we accept achievements for past years. We focuses primary on 2023-2024, but earlier works are also welcomed.

We will ask all presenters to prepare 2-page summary of your achievement, which will be published as "CaMa-Flood annual progress report". We will share GoodleDocs URL for online edit, or you can just send the MS Word file by email. Deadline for 2 page summary is 28th February.

### Related Meeting
#### AOGS Large-River Modelling Session
We will organize a Large-scale River Modeling session in AOGS2025.<br>
The meeting is through 27 July to 1 August in Singapore. Please consider joining, and I'm looking forward to meeting you there.<br>

<span style="color: red">The abstract submission deadline is 18 February.</span>

(Session Info)

**HS09: Advances in Large-scale River Modeling: Developments and Applications**

Conveners: 
- Dr. Dai Yamazaki (The University of Tokyo)
- Dr Peirong Lin (Peking University)
- Dr Fitsum Woldemeskel (Bureau of Meteorology)
- Dr Xudong Zhou (Ningbo University)

Scope:<br>
Large-scale river modeling has continuously evolved in recent years. This evolution is due to many factors such as better conceptualization of river flow physics, new schemes to represent river infrastructures, advancement of baseline geography data like elevation and river networks, and increasing computational resources. These advancements enabled more advanced applications of large-scale river models, such as global-scale flood risk assessment, real-time flood forecast on the continental scale, coupling with Earth system models, and integration of satellite river observations into models through data assimilation. In this session, we welcome any research topics related to the development and/or applications of large-scale river models. New scientific discoveries obtained from large-scale river modeling and/or local decision-support applications are also welcome to submit. We will review the frontier research on large-scale river modeling and discuss next challenges and future directions.

#### Next CaMa-Flood user/developer meeting
We are thinking about having the 2nd CaMa-Flood user/developer meeting in Summer-Autumn 2026. The meeting plan is under consideration now. Please wait for a while.
