### About the CaMa-Flood annual briefing

The CaMa-Flood Annual Progress Briefing is a yearly event to review achievements related to the global river model **CaMa-Flood**.  
This briefing provides an opportunity for CaMa-Flood users, developers, and contributors to **showcase their achievements**, as well as a chance to enhance the research network within the community.

The briefing starts with a summary of key progress reported by the core development team.  
This is followed by a series of short talks in which CaMa-Flood users introduce their achievements.  
In addition, one or two invited talks may be organized to highlight particularly important achievements.

The primary purpose of the annual briefing is to create a catalogue of CaMa-Flood-related research and make it visible both within the CaMa-Flood community and to the broader research community.  
To this end, CaMa-Flood users and contributors are asked to prepare a short summary of their achievement (1–2 pages), which will be compiled and published as the **CaMa-Flood Annual Progress Report** in PDF format.  
In addition, presentations given during the online meeting will be recorded and released as a **video report**, allowing participants’ research achievements to be featured in a lasting and accessible form.

**Note:** We also plan to hold a [CaMa-Flood user/developer meeting](../cmf-mmet-2024/) every two years, which prioritizes in-depth discussions on frontier topics and future directions.  
The annual briefing primarily focuses on summarizing recent achievements, while networking within the CaMa-Flood user community remains an important objective of both meetings.

### Note for presenters

The meeting aims to **share achievements related to CaMa-Flood, with a primary focus on research published in 2025**.  
We therefore assume that the work has already been made publicly available (e.g., journal publications, online documents, or web content), and that a summary of the work will be presented at the briefing.  
(If the work is not yet published, it can be introduced in a future annual briefing.)

**If an achievement has not been presented in previous CaMa-Flood Annual Briefings, relevant papers published in 2024 or earlier are also welcome.**  
(Work that has not yet been published can be introduced in a future annual briefing.)


Any achievements related to CaMa-Flood are welcome, including:
- Development of new schemes or tools for CaMa-Flood
- Application studies using CaMa-Flood (e.g., flood risk assessment)
- New datasets or tools useful for CaMa-Flood
- Use of CaMa-Flood in climate or weather services (operational or applied studies)

All presenters are requested to submit a **2-page achievement summary**.  
Please submit the summary in an **editable format** (e.g., **MS Word or equivalent**).  
The organizing team will take care of **formatting, layout, and overall design** to ensure consistency across contributions, based on the style of the previous annual report.

If you are unsure whether your achievement fits within the scope of the meeting, please feel free to contact the organizing team  
(yamazaki [at] iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp).

### AOGS 2026: Large-scale River Modeling Session

We will organize a **Large-scale River Modeling session** at **AOGS 2026**.

The conference will be held from **2 to 7 August 2026** in **Fukuoka, Japan**.  
Please consider joining the session, and we look forward to meeting you there.

#### Session Information
**HS12: Advances in Large-scale River Modeling: Developments and Applications**

**Conveners**
- Dr. Dai Yamazaki (The University of Tokyo)
- Dr. Peirong Lin (Peking University)
- Dr. Fitsum Woldemeskel (Bureau of Meteorology)
- Dr. Xudong Zhou (Ningbo University)

**Scope**  
Large-scale river modeling has continuously evolved in recent years due to improved conceptualization of river flow physics, new schemes for representing river infrastructures, advances in baseline geographic data (e.g., elevation and river networks), and increasing computational resources.  
These developments have enabled advanced applications such as global-scale flood risk assessment, continental-scale real-time flood forecasting, coupling with Earth system models, and integration of satellite river observations through data assimilation.

This session welcomes research related to the **development and/or applications of large-scale river models**, as well as new scientific discoveries derived from such models and local decision-support applications.  
The session aims to review frontier research in large-scale river modeling and to discuss future challenges and directions.
