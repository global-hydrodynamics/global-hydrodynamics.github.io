# **OSM Water Layer**
**Surface Waters in OpenStreetMap (Global)**

OSM Water Layer is a global surface water dataset generated by extracting water-related features from OpenStreetMap (OSM).  
Both **filtered OSM data (PBF)** and **rasterized maps (GeoTIFF)** are available.

---

## Data Summary
We extracted surface waters from the OpenStreetMap `planet.pbf` archive:  
<a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStreetMap Planet data</a>. 

Water-related features were extracted using the following OSM tags:  
- `natural=water`  
- `waterway=*`  
- `landuse=reservoir`

A raster surface water map was generated at **3 arc-second resolution** (~90 m at the equator).  
For rasterization, surface waters are classified into four categories: 

- **Large Lake & River**: surface water represented as *Polygon*  
- **Major River**: `waterway=riverbank, river`  
- **Canal**: `waterway=canal, drain`  
- **Minor Stream**: `waterway=ditch, stream, brook, wadi, drystream`

## Data Description

### Global vector database (PBF)
The global vector database is prepared in OpenStreetMap **PBF format** and can be handled by **OSMOSIS**. 

### Rasterized GeoTIFF map
- CRS: **WGS84**
- Tiling: **5° × 5° tiles** (6000 × 6000 pixels each)
- Filename convention: the filename represents the **center of the lower-left pixel**.  
  Example: `n30w120.tif` covers N30–N35, W120–W115 (more accurately: N29.99958333–N34.99958333, W120.0004167–W115.0004167).  
- The 5° tiles are also distributed as one global **tar.gz** archive. 

Note: High resolution version for Japan is also available.
