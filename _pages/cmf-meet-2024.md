# CaMa-Flood developer/user international meeting 2024


**We will be hosting the first-ever international meeting on CaMa-Flood and global hydrodynamics <br>
on 5th and 6th July, 2024 (Friday and Saturday) at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo.**

*We are currently organizing the meeting. There might be some changes on a detailed program.*


### About the meeting
Over the past 15 years since its initial development, the global river model CaMa-Flood has undergone significant advancements. We have introduced numerous new model schemes, incorporated new baseline topography datasets, and refined our analysis methods. Furthermore, CaMa-Flood has become widely utilized for various applications, including flood risk assessment, Earth's climate system modeling, and data assimilation.

We are excited to announce the first-ever international meeting for CaMa-Flood developers and users. This gathering aims to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and expertise, allowing participants to share insights, discuss current advancements, and explore future developments and applications of CaMa-Flood.

All CaMa-Flood developers and users are cordially invited to participate in the meeting. Moreover, we extend a warm welcome to all researchers interested in global river hydrodynamics, regardless of whether they are currently using CaMa-Flood. We look forward to fostering a diverse and enriching exchange of ideas and collaborations during the event.
