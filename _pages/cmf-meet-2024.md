# CaMa-Flood developer/user international meeting 2024

5-6th July 2024 (Fri-Sat) @ Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo

Note: We are organizing the meeting now. The registration form and detailed program will be announced later (expected in February 2024). There might be some changes in a future.


### About the meeting
During 15 years since the initial development, the global river model CaMa-Flood has been advanced significantly. We have developed many new model schemes, new baseline topography datasets, and detailed analysis methods. Also, CaMa-Flood is now widely used for various applications, such as flood risk assessment, Earth's climate system modelling, data assimilation. 

We'd like to have the very first international meeting among the CaMa-Flood developers and users, so share our knowledge and knowhow, and to discuss about future developments and applications. 

All CaMa-Flood developers and users are welcome to join. We are also happy to welcome potential new collaborators who are interested in CaMa-Flood model.

### Date and location

The venue is a conference hall in the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo. It's in UTokyo Komaba-2 Research Campus (very near from Shibuya, central Tokyo).
