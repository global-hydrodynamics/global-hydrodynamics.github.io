#### Unraveling the interactions between the global water cycle, climate, and society<br>through the integration of physical modeling and satellite observations of terrestrial water dynamics

Global Hydrodynamics is a research field that aims to understand, at the scale of the entire Earth, the transport and storage of terrestrial water and its interactions with the Earth system.

## Main Research Themes

### Development of global river hydrodynamics models

Water flows in rivers and floodplains are inherently multi-scale phenomena, strongly controlled by both basin-scale water budgets (over 1,000 km) and fine-scale channel and micro-topographic features (below 100 m). A central challenge in global hydrodynamics modeling is how to bridge this large gap in spatial scales within a single, consistent theoretical framework.

I develop global river models (e.g., CaMa-Flood) that can consistently simulate water levels, discharge, and inundation extent using efficient algorithms based on subgrid topography representation. Rather than focusing only on discharge, my goal is to reproduce, consistently at the global scale, the basic physical principle that “water flows from higher to lower places.” Designing model structures that satisfy both computational efficiency and physical fidelity is key to this effort.

CaMa-Flood is one of the few models currently capable of consistently simulating discharge, water levels, and inundation extent for all rivers on Earth. It is released as open source, has over 1,000 registered users, and has grown into an international modeling platform used by research institutes and operational meteorological agencies worldwide.

### Development of high-accuracy global topography and hydrography datasets

Accurate simulations of terrestrial water dynamics require not only advanced numerical models but also high-quality topographic information that governs where and how water flows. At the global scale, building hydrologically consistent topography datasets is itself a major challenge. While satellite observations provide global coverage, they often contain noise and systematic errors that can hinder the correct representation of drainage structures and flow paths.

To address this, I integrate multiple satellite datasets and geospatial information and reconstruct them into river topography datasets consistent with natural drainage structures, thereby developing foundational global topography/hydrography datasets for terrestrial water dynamics modeling. Representative products include the global elevation dataset MERIT DEM, the global hydrography dataset MERIT Hydro, and the Japan flow-direction map J-FlwDir. By systematically building hydrologically consistent geospatial foundations, I contribute to the broader Earth science community.

### Monitoring the terrestrial water cycle by integrating models and satellite observations

Recent advances in satellite technology are making it increasingly possible to observe water surface elevation and inundation extent at the global scale. However, observations remain incomplete in space and time, and observation data alone cannot reveal the full picture of the water cycle.

I therefore develop data assimilation and model optimization approaches that integrate numerical models with satellite and in situ observations, enabling estimation of the global water cycle through the fusion of theory and data. Quantities that are not directly observable—such as river channel depth or floodplain storage—can also be inferred through model–data consistency. This inference process is an attempt to advance both “measuring” and “understanding” terrestrial water dynamics at the scale of the Earth.

### Flood risk under climate change and water–society interactions

Climate change may alter precipitation patterns and the frequency of extreme discharges, but its impacts are intertwined with basin topography, river characteristics, land use, and societal responses in complex ways. Physically based global hydrodynamics simulations provide a foundation for treating these interacting factors within a unified framework.

By coupling hydrodynamics with climate-model outputs and conducting large ensemble analyses, I assess future flood risks and probabilistic hazard metrics. I also investigate how terrestrial water variability affects society and ecosystems, and how human activities feed back into hydrodynamic systems. In problem settings that span the boundary between natural and social systems, hydrodynamics models play a role in connecting fundamental science to real-world decision making. I also work with industry–academia collaborations to explore climate change adaptation strategies centered on flood risk.

### Playable Hydrology: water-cycle education based on rainfall–runoff modeling

Rainfall–runoff processes are fundamental hydrological mechanisms underlying floods, yet their multi-stage and nonlinear structures make them difficult for beginners to grasp intuitively. To address this, I developed “SplashTune,” which turns physically based rainfall–runoff simulations into an interactive game, and I study process-based hydrology education methods. By presenting a framework in which floods are understood not merely as disaster events but as dynamical consequences of differences in basin conditions and surface states, I aim to help more people recognize both the intellectual appeal of hydrological models and their societal relevance.

Under the concept of “Playable Hydrology,” this research integrates physical models with game-based learning to bridge hydrological expertise and societal water literacy. At the same time, it aims to translate model-based thinking cultivated in cutting-edge hydrodynamics research into educational practice, thereby narrowing the gap between frontier research and the classroom.

### International research hub for global terrestrial water dynamics

Based at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, I work to build an international hub for research on global terrestrial water dynamics. I place strong emphasis on training PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, while actively hosting international students, interns, and visiting/sabbatical scholars to cultivate a collaborative environment where researchers with diverse backgrounds work together.

I also lead community building in global river modeling through organizing international workshops and continuously planning international conference sessions, including the CaMa-Flood International Developer/User Meeting. By advancing research, education, and community development as an integrated effort, I aim to strengthen the international research infrastructure of global hydrology and foster the next generation of researchers.
