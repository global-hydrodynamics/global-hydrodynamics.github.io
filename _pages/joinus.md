# How to join us?

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and perseverance. If you are fascinated by nature and the Earth and wish to understand its dynamics using data and models, we warmly encourage you to consider joining our group.

You will have the opportunity to work on frontier scientific challenges in global hydrodynamics by integrating numerical modelling, satellite remote sensing, and data integration approaches. We aim to understand, describe, and predict the dynamics of terrestrial water systems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.

If you are interested, please feel free to contact us by email (yamadai [at] iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp). We are happy to have an informal discussion about potential research projects and research life in our group.

## Current open positions

**Note:** We currently do not have funding for additional postdoctoral or PhD positions. However, we can host postdoctoral researchers who have secured their own fellowships. Prospective students are expected to have a scholarship or be self-funded. We are happy to provide support after you apply to our group.

### Application to postdoctoral positions

If you wish to join us as a postdoctoral researcher, please contact us by email first (as potential opportunities are not always publicly advertised). We are also happy to discuss the possibility of applying for external fellowships.

**For international postdoctoral researchers:** You may apply for the [JSPS International Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-inv_researchers/index.html). Please contact us at least two months before the JSPS deadline, as the internal deadline at the University of Tokyo is typically one month earlier.

**For Japanese postdoctoral researchers:** Please consider applying for the [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/). We recommend contacting us well in advance if you plan to apply.

### Application to PhD and Master’s courses

If you are interested in joining us as a PhD or Master’s student, please apply through either the  
[Department of Civil Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo](http://www.civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)  
or the  
[Graduate Program of Environmental Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences](https://gpes.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html).

#### International student program (Department of Civil Engineering)

If you are a non-Japanese student residing outside Japan, please apply through the international scholarship program of the Department of Civil Engineering via the [Foreign Student Office (FSO)](http://www.civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/admission/). Information on available scholarships and application schedules is provided on the FSO website. Typical examples include:

- MEXT Scholarship (University Recommendation): apply through FSO  
- MEXT Scholarship (Embassy Recommendation): apply through the Japanese Embassy in your country  
- CSC Scholarship (for Chinese students): apply through FSO and obtain approval from CSC  
- Other external scholarships: please contact us if you wish to join with external funding or as a self-funded student

#### Entrance examination (Department of Civil Engineering)

If you are Japanese or a foreign resident in Japan, please take the [entrance examination](http://www.civil.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/graduate_school/) of the Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo. The examination is usually held in late August each year. For details, please refer to the official entrance examination webpage.

#### Graduate Program of Environmental Sciences (GPES)

We also accept students through the Graduate Program of Environmental Sciences in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Application information is available [here](https://gpes.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/how-to-apply/index.html).

### Visitors for collaborative research

We welcome visitors for collaborative research, including sabbatical stays, visiting scholars or students, and internships. If you have a concrete plan, please contact us and we will be happy to discuss the possibilities.
